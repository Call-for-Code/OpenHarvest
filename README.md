OpenHarvest is a web application designed to balance farming production in India. Farmers in India are struggling with marketing their crops. The greatest instance of this was with India's recent onion shortage. Essentially, farmers are being told that the market needs specific goods which results in a massive surplus as all the farmers dedicated their crops to the market's needs. This results in many farmers’ watching entire crops go to waste. These crops can take over a year to grow and leave the farmer in debt rather than making a profit. One of our group members has great insight into this issue as he has family in the farming industry.

OpenHarvest was a top solution created for the 2021 Call for Code IBMer Challenge. It took on a key agricultural challenge prompt in the [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) competition.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Included with node)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  Instructions on deploying and configuring this are included below

### Building app

#### Backend

1. Install mkcert. For Mac or Linux: `brew install mkcert`. Windows user can download `mkcert.exe` from [Mkcert Github](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases)

   Install ts-node for Windows users in backend folder

   `npm i -g ts-node`

2. Create Certificates

   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. Create Mongodb dData directory, anywhere you want but preferably in the same directory as Docker Compose. This is optional for Windows users.

   ```bash
   mkdir {YOUR_PATH}
   ```

4. Create docker-compose.yml.

   For Mac and Linux:

   ```bash
   version: '3.7'
   services:
    mongodb_container:
      image: mongo:latest
      environment:
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: {YOUR_ROOT_USER}
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: {YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
        - 27017:27017
      volumes:
        - {YOUR_MONGO_DB_DATA_DIR}:/data/db
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```bash
   version: '3.7'
   services:
    mongodb_container:
      image: mongo:latest
      environment:
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: {YOUR_ROOT_USER}
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: {YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
        - 27017:27017
      volumes:
        - data:/mongodb/data/db
   volumes:
     data:
      driver: local
   ```

5. `cd` into `/backend` and rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholder values.

6. ```bash
   npm i
   npm start
   ```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd react-app
npm install
npm start
```
