## Short description

### What's the problem?

Essentially farmers are told that India is having a shortage on onions for example. The farmers then grow as many onions as they can. 6 months pass and all of these farmers have been growing so many onions that there is a massive surplus that will go to waste. The farmers ruined their crops to produce this and did not get to sell. One of our group membersâ€™ father is a farmer in India so he has a lot of insight on this.
