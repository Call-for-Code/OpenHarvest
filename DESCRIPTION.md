# Open-Harvest
Open Harvest is a web application designed to balance farming production in India.
Farmers in India are struggling with marketing their crops. The greatest instance of this was with India's recent onion shortage. Essentially, farmers are being told that the market needs specific goods which results in a massive surplus as all the farmers dedicated their crops to the market's needs. This results in many farmer's watching entire crops go to waste. These crops can take over a year to grow and leave the farmer in debt rather than making a profit. One of our group members has great insight into this issue as he has family in the farming industry.

## Design

Implemented using IBM's Carbon Design System and hosted on IBM Cloudant, Open-Harvest provides the solution for farmers using a straightforword UI accessible on any device. The user will create an account, registering their lot and crop details along with their own. Once provided The dashboard will display the user statistics  through graphs and other visuals. 

### Target Audience

The incentive for the farmers to tell us what they are growing is a challenge. Long term if a farmer shares updates on their crops then they will also get to see what his competitors are growing (win win scenario). However, we need a more immediate incentive. We decided our project is for the government of India. The government has enough power to use our solution to make a change with the farmers 


Targeted to each country
The aim of the product is to stabilise the production of crops.
Over the year there's a consistent volume of crops that are being produced to feed the people.
This is why it makes the project a best fit for governing bodies as they can plan for this.
