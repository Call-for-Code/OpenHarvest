# OpenHarvest

Open Harvest is a web application designed to balance farming production in India. Farmers in India are struggling with marketing their crops. The greatest instance of this was with India's recent onion shortage. Essentially, farmers are being told that the market needs specific goods which results in a massive surplus as all the farmers dedicated their crops to the market's needs. This results in many farmers’ watching entire crops go to waste. These crops can take over a year to grow and leave the farmer in debt rather than making a profit. One of our group members has great insight into this issue as he has family in the farming industry.

## Design

Implemented using the IBM Carbon Design System and hosted on IBM Cloudant, OpenHarvest provides the solution for farmers using a straightforward UI accessible on any device. The user will create an account, registering their lot and crop details along with their own. Once provided the dashboard will display the user statistics through graphs and other visuals.

The dashboard will also have a public view where all the data collected from users is gathered and displayed. This will provide the farmers with the insight they need to make an informed decision on their land use to ensure profits.

## Recommendation feature

OpenHarvest's recommendation feature will accept details on what a farmer may be planning to grow on their lot, analyze the entirety of our database and provide a proposal suitable for the farmer's requirements that will have the harvest and profit.

## Target audience

There would be difficulty in providing incentive for farmers to publicly share their crop details. Long term if a farmer shares updates on their crops, then they will also get to see what his competitors are growing. We decided OpenHarvest is a tool best utilized by the government of India. The government has enough power to use our solution to make a change with the farmers.

## The future of OpenHarvest

The goal of OpenHarvest is to stabilize the production of crops. Every year there is a consistent volume of crops produced to feed the people of India. OpenHarvest is best fit for governing bodies across the globe to assist in planning for the future of their country.
